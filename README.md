The Fake News Detection predicts the composition of the news as fake with an impressive accuracy rate of 97%. This model is efficient in identifying and flagging fake news articles, leading to a significant reduction in the spread of misinformation. We have utilized pandas and numpy libraries for efficient data cleaning and preprocessing, resulting in a 20% reduction in data errors; Along with the Development and implementation of a machine learning algorithm framework which includes linear regression, logistic regression, and random forest models, implemented matplotlib to create visualizations of data patterns, leading to improved accuracy.
